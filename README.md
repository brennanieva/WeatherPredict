**Data:**
* daily high and low temperatures
* pressure
* wind direction
* cloud cover
* precipitation

<h3>10/15/2019</h3>


**Goals:**
* guessing tomorrow's temperature based on yesterday's and today's
* estimating probability of precipitation and/or cloud cover based on barometric pressure
* using a nearest-neighbor classification to predict what the weather will be tomorrow

**Released:**
* Full data available from Jan 2019 to August 2019
    * Incomplete data August 2019 to October 2019
<h3>10/20/2019</h3>

**Goals**
* try out some very simple predictions for temperature, such as:
* Assume temp will be the same: tomorrow_prediction = today
* Assume temp will continue the trend from the past two days: tomorrow_prediction = today + (today - yesterday).

**Released:**
* Data sorted
    * TrainingSets
        * Weather2019
        * Jan2018
    * TestSets
        * Feb2018
